    <h1>My Journey in Web Development</h1>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a passionate student learning web development. I believe that the web is one of the most powerful platforms for creativity and innovation. My goal is to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create beautiful and functional websites that make a difference in people's lives.</p>
    
    <h3>My Learning Path</h3>
    <p>I'm currently enrolled in a comprehensive web development course where I'm learning the fundamentals of HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript programming. The course covers everything from basic markup to advanced interactive features. I'm particularly excited about learning modern web technologies and best practices.</p>
    
    <h4>Resources and Inspiration</h4>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I love exploring the web for inspiration and learning new techniques. One of my favorite resources is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>, which provides excellent documentation and tutorials for web developers of all skill levels. I highly recommend it to anyone starting their web development journey!</p>
