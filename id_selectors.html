        This is the first paragraph that demonstrates how the universal selector removes default margins and padding, while paragraphs get custom styling with padding and soft borders.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The universal selector (*) is a powerful CSS selector that targets all elements on the page. It's commonly used to reset default browser styles and create a consistent foundation for styling.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        ID selectors are used to style specific elements with unique identifiers. They have higher specificity than class selectors and should be used sparingly for truly unique elements.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Notice how all elements now have consistent spacing and styling thanks to the combination of universal selector for reset and specific selectors for targeted styling.
